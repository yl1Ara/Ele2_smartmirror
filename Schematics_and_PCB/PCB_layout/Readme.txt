Here is basically all and maybe more than needed data about PCB. It includes:

-Simple black and white top and bot .pdf files that have copper layout for etching the pcb top and bottom sides.
-Two CAM photos called Topside and Bottomside .png that have a colored CAM png images.
-.fbrd has all the data and can be opened with fusion 360 and maybe other CAD programs
-Behind Gerber file you can find the gerber files if you want to send same PCB to be made somewhere else
